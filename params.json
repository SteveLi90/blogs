Now I am working for a small staffing services company. I hope I can work for google in the future!!\r\n\r\nI am from China, so the grammar of these blogs is not perfect, but acceptable. I try to improve my English writing skills.\r\n\r\nI wish github is suppose to add the tag or category feature in the future, so I am able to group my blogs.\\\r\n\r\nThank you so much. Everyone have a great day!!!\r\n\r\n[sorting](https://github.com/SteveLi90/blogs/sorting_algo.html)",
